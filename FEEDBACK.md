  - Description:
	- Thank you for the opportunity to demonstrate my skills. I enjoyed the exercise and found it to be a good challenge as it has been a number of years since I have used these tools and frameworks. 
	- You will see that I have tests for test case 14 and 15. Each page model uses a baseHelper class to handle the common functionality of the page. I have also used a data provider to provide the test data for the tests.
	- Each page inherits from a basePaage class that handles the common functionality of the page. This allows for easy reuse of code and reduces duplication. There isn't much here at the moment as I just wanted to capture the concept.
  	- I didn't find time to implement the API tests, but I have included a placeholder for them in the codebase.
	- I have also inlcuded a basic github action workflow to run the tests when changes are pushed. This will help ensure that the tests are run automatically and that any issues are caught early.
	- I have also included a [GETTING_STARTED](GETTING_STARTED.md) file to help you get started with running the tests.
